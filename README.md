Responsive Landing Page | HTML + CSS + JavaScript + SCSS | Accessible + Interactive UI

üìù Project Description (EN):

This project is a modern, responsive Landing Page built with a strong focus on semantic HTML structure and accessibility best practices. The layout is developed using HTML5, SCSS/SASS, and vanilla JavaScript, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and responsiveness across devices.

Key technical highlights:

‚ú¶ Semantic HTML & Accessibility ‚Äì Proper heading hierarchy, use of ARIA roles and labels for screen readers, keyboard-friendly navigation, and clear visual focus states for interactive elements.

‚ú¶ Component-based SCSS structure ‚Äì Styles are modular and organized, enabling easy reuse and efficient scalability.

‚ú¶ Responsive layout with Flexbox & CSS Grid ‚Äì Ensures clean alignment and distribution of content and icon blocks across all screen sizes.

‚ú¶ Optimized SVG usage ‚Äì Icons and vector illustrations are integrated as inline SVGs, preserving visual sharpness on retina displays and allowing style manipulation via CSS.

‚ú¶ JavaScript Interactions:

Interactive carousel/slider

Mobile dropdown menu with background dimming
